# define a circular playing field
# divide field into radial thirds
# players move on edge of circle
# movement fields overlap by 10px 
# ball starts at center and moves in a random direction until bounces off a player
# if player misses and ball leaves field the other two players score a half point
# if ball was in range of both players and niether gets it the third player wins a full point
# ball slowly speeds up
